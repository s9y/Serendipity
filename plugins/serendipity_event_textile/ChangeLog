2.0.1:
     * Fix one PHP 8 warning
     * Fix error when opening entries in blogs that had the prior version installed
     * Link to textile-lang.com to explain the syntax below the comment form, instead of defunct
       sites

2.0: Remove old textile parsers and switch to netcarver/textile v4.1.3
     This will improve compatibility with current PHP version (8.x).
