    * Doesn't accept existing but empty images anymore.

Version 1.56: (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Removed inline styles, added class avatar_right and avatar_left.
      If not found set in css, the plugin will emit a default style for
      those two.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Twitter and identica where not fetched correctly if fetched first.

Version 1.49 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Pavatar in blogs having redirection didn't work, if Pavatar link
      was only available in rel link info.

Version 1.48 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * FIX: PHP compatibility was broken since 1.46 :-/
    * Added Identica Avatar.
      This is mainly used for Identica Pingbacks and should be used in 
      front of Favatar, else the Identica sign will show up.
    * Code cleanup.

Version 1.47 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Disabled debug logging into template_c

Version 1.46 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Helpfiles
    * Cleanup.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Added buildin wavatar suport.
    * Support for Gravatar fallbacks identyicon, monsterid and wavatar.
    * Optimized trackback avatars: Querypars will be stripped from URL.
      Now in example S8Y blogs always get the same Avatar cached, not 
      one per trackback.

Version 1.43 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Option for adding the authors name to the ALT attribute of the
      avatar image. Normaly this is filled with a *, but blind people
      depend on the ALT tag.

Version 1.42 (brockhaus)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Encoded _ in user urls in order to differ them from the 
      seperators. urlencode doesn't encode _. Thanks to Tino Schwarze
      finding and fixing this.

Version 1.41 (garvinhicking)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fixed Last-Modified Header of avatar images.
    
Version 1.40 ()
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Added ycon support (mo, http://moblog.wiredwings.com)
    
------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.39 (brockhaus):

    * Monster Avatars are cached now, too, as creating them costs time.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.38 (brockhaus):

    * Support for Monster ID avatars (details found on
      http://www.splitbrain.org/go/monsterid)
    * Crashed while fresh installing and cache time set to 0
    * Allows configuring absolute path to standard avatar now.
    * After saving the configuration now the cache is *always* cleared,
      in order to make the changes visible immidiately even if caching
      is enabled.
    * If the plugin is unable to write into the cache, it will log it
      in debug mode and show the default image, if no cached file found.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.37 (brockhaus):

    * The avatar type infoline below the comments editor is optional now

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.36 (brockhaus):

    * Added new option: You can define, that the plugin should not
      produce avatar image directly but a smarty tag only. If this 
      option is switched on, you can define in your comments template,
      where the avatar should be displayed using the smarty tag
      $comment.comment_avatar
    * Css class of avatar will change depending on where it is
      displayed. For normal comments it will be "comment_avatar", for the
      recent entries plugin it will be "serendipity_plugin_comments_avatar"
      in order to have the possibility to easily style it.
    * Avatar alignment configuration: The configured alignment will be
      used, if the avatar is written directliy (no smarty tag).
    * New option for switching on/off the avatar images in the sidebar
      plugin (recent comments).
    * Supported avatar methods where displayed in the contact form
      plugin too, but this made no sense. Disabled it there.

Version 1.35 (brockhaus):

    * Corrected errors in English language file. (Thanks to Don!)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.34 (brockhaus):

    * Gravatars rating doesn't work reliable. My G rated Gravatar is only
      shown, if I use Gravatar X rating. :-/
      Added an option to switch off Gravatars rating parameter (what 
      should be the same as using X rating)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.33 (brockhaus):

    * Pavatar: X-Pavatar Header is supported now again and is the first
      pavatar autodetect method used.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.32 (brockhaus):

    * MyBlogLog default avatar was not detected correctly anmore. :-/
    * If no email nor url is given, but default avatar is defined, now
      the default avatar is displayed.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.31 (brockhaus):

    * Changed call-time pass-by-reference bug (fetchAvatar)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.30 (brockhaus):

    * Standard Avatar was not displayed in subdirectory blog 
      installtions.
    * Gravatar link was slightly wrong (but working)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.29 (brockhaus):

    * Bugfix 1.27 added http:// even if no URL was given at all.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.28 (brockhaus):

    * With Serendipity 1.1 it was not possible to configure a default
      avatar. The configuration was not 1.1 compatible.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.27 (brockhaus):

    * If the writer entered his url as www.domain.de instead of 
      http://www.domain.de, the Avatar was not always loaded correctly

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.26 (brockhaus):

    * MyBlogLog changed avatar calling slightly resuling MyBlogLog Avatar
      fallback not working anymore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.25 (garvinhicking):

    * Replaced align with style attributes, as there is no align in
      XHTML

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.24 (brockhaus):

    * Check MyBlogLog result if it really is an image.
    * Cleaning up cache directory when setting cache to 0.
    * Debug logging disabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.23 (brockhaus):

    * While fresh fetching P/Favatars, the Plugin will only accept 
      responses declared as image by the remote server. This will
      prevent accepting potential error html pages as Avatar images.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.22 (brockhaus):

    * Fetch redirected P/Favatars, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.21 (brockhaus):

    * Avatar fetching was broken when cache was disabled.
    * Browser was not able to cache default avatars, because a wrong
      cache time (in the past) was sent.
    * Checks, if cached file looks like an image, before sending it
      to the client.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.20 (brockhaus):

    * Avatar image title is the author's name now instead of Avatar (V.)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.19 (brockhaus):

    * Made the browser cache avatars resulting in a very good
      performance boost!

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.18 (brockhaus):

    * Debugging loging disabled.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.17 (brockhaus):

    * If cache is enabled, *everything* is cached now. Known writers
      won't produce *any* external server call, if allready cached.
      This is a very nice performance boost! Thanks to garvin for hinting
      me.
    * Anti hacking patches by garvinhickins

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.16 (garvinhicking):

    * Coding style

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.14 (brockhaus):

    * Fallback possibility for MyBlogLog implemented! :-) But it is
      slow even with caching optimazation. MBL shouldn't be the first
      option.
    * Fifth method slot in configuration, as MBL now supports fallback, too.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.13 (brockhaus):

    * Advice changed: It is not the statistic plugin producing not 
      working Pavatars/Favatars but the exit tracking plugin.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.12 (brockhaus):

    * MyBlogLog avatars are cached now, too.

    * Pages redirecting to a default page, if the requested item was not
      found, are supported now, too. Former the Avatar Plugin assumed,
      that the default page is the P/Favatar.

    * Default configuration now ordered like this: Gravatar -> Pavatar 
      -> Favatar -> Default Avatar.

    * Added advice, that this plugin has to be executed before any link
      changing plugin.

    * Reading configured plugin path. Former it was 'plugin' always.

    * Dropped gravatar border setting, as it is not working (anymore?)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.11, testing version not released to CVS/Spartacus (brockhaus):

    * Fallback for Gravatar working! But this shows an default avatar
      to Gravatar, not mattering the settings. So revoked this setting.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.10 (brockhaus):

    * Pavatar / Avatar information where never loaded from cache
    
    * .. but after beeing loaded from cache it produced an endless
      request loop for images loaded from the local blog (if comment
      sidebar plugin was enabled)

    * Height setting for image was called "heigth".. :-/
    
    * Gravarar caching didn't work reliable, if a default avatar was
      given.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.9 (brockhaus):

    * While searching for Pavatar, the Favatar was loaded as Pavatar,
      if no Pavatar image but a favicon was found. (Thanks to El Burro)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.8 (brockhaus):

    * Plugin was unable to load Favatars/Pavatars, if a redirection was
      signaled at the url given by the commentor as homepage. Garvin's
      blog is such a page..

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.7 (brockhaus):

    * Added support for Pavatars (www.pavatar.com)
    
    * Added support for MyBlogLog Avatars (www.mybloglog.com)

    * The order for trying avatar methods and what kind of avatars are
      supported is now configurable.

    * Standard avatar may be one of them (should be last)

    * Option for not giving the default avatar to gravatar  even if one
      is defined. (We want less dataprofiles..)

    * Fetch default avatar via mediadatabase in the configuration.
	
    * Image size is assured now in HTML code.
	
    * Below the comment only actual configured avatar methods are shown
      as supported.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.5 (garvinhickins): 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version 1.4 (garvinhickins): 

------------------------------------------------------------------------
