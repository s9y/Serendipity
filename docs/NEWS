Version 2.0-beta4 / RC? ()
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix bug in entry listing, which showed wrong categories for
      entries (Issue #201)
      
    * Improve RegExp for Feed-URL matching, thanks to fugue88
    
Version 2.0-beta3 (July 25th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Move admin/media_showitem.tpl to theme's directory in 2k11. With
      an adaptation in serendipity_admin_image_selector.php, this now is
      a "true" frontend template which uses the styles of the frontend
      theme. Theme authors might want to adapt it to their themes.

    * Moved general syndication plugin option into the core

    * Smarty 3.1.19 upgrade (see changelog)

    * Fixed thumbnail recreation, Issue #134

    * Merged external JS libraries into a central "plugins.js" of the 2k11
      backend template, can be updated through 
      templates/2k11/admin/js/gruntipity.php helper script.

    * Adapted database table structure change for statistics, shoutbox,
      karma and spamblock plugin (for new field definition of "ip" field)
      Thanks to rohdef!

    * Added new option "enabledBackendPopups" that allow to specify
      if inline modal dialogs or popups are used in the backend for
      e.g. the category selectory and media library

    * added experimental support for PHP/SMARTY IN MEMORY caching
      Enabled by default, if classes found loaded.
      Disable with 
        $serendipity['disable_apc'] = true;
      and
        $serendipity['disable_memcache'] = true;

    * Support added in serendipity_db_schema_import for sqlite 
      autoincrement

    * Remove Google Reader button from syndication plugin options

    * Add subToMe-button to syndication plugin and change its defaults

    * Use Browsercache to save cache and restore entries

    * Improved installer to forbid using database table prefixes with
      special characters

    * Themes using Engines are now able to use the parent's
      configuration

    * Prevent "new" plugin api to install double instances of plugins
      that are not stackable (issue #45)

    * Back button in plugin-config

    * Adapted serendipity_editor.js to provide more global (though
      deprecated) API access methods for plugins like amazonchooser
      and linktrimmer, to perform insertion. Also fixed the
      insertion of text when the ID of the element is not prefixed

    * Move sort by name to simple filter in ML, replace file extension

    * Remember selected media library folder

    * Show upload-success or error with the ajax image uploader

    * Fix preview entry exception (issue #119)

    * Add serendipity.toggle_collapsible as a reusable JS function
      for the core backend and backend sections emitted by plugins as
      an easy way to provide show/hide functionality. (yellowled)

    * Fixed media insert target bug (issued by #143, #145, #121)

    * Fixed publish drafted-entries via dashboard (issue #160)

    * All frontend themes that rely on the bundled Core jQuery library
      are currently using the jquery.noConflict-mode for compatibility
      to older plugins.
      This mode is now considered deprecated and will be removed in 
      future releases. A new variable:
        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery-noconflict'] = false;
      in your theme's config.inc.php file can now turn of that
      noConflict-mode.

    * Due to distinction of backend and frontend themes, each theme
      that provides a custom jquery.js now only does so for the
      frontend. The backend now listens to a:

        $serendipity['capabilities']['jquery_backend'] = false;

      variable, and the file needs to be jquery_backend.js that
      a backend theme would reference to.

    * Changed 2k11's config.inc.php file to provide a more stable
      call of event hooks so that other themes can also hook
      their own events.

    * Changed JS for category filtering and its reset button to be a
      reusable function, which is now also used in the list of
      installable plugins.

    * Fixed wrong local documentation URL in plugin configuration

    * Added new "backend_dashboard" event-hook for plugins to use
      within dashboard.

    * Backend and Frontend themes can now be set independently from
      each other. New backend themes now need to set:

        Backend: Yes

      in their info.txt file. If you adapt a custom admin theme,
      ensure that it is compatible to the new "2k11" backend to
      ensure proper future usage within Serendipity. The bulletproof
      backend will now no longer be recognized as a backend theme
      option, but can be selected as a new frontend theme, while
      using 2k11 (=default) in the backend.

    * Include klogger, call it as $serendipity['logger']->debug/error.
      The log-level can be set in the general configuration and is
      disabled by default.

    * Fixed missing s9ymdb ID

    * Add HTTP_Request2 and dependencies as bundled libraries and
      update PEAR library to version 1.9.4

    * Implemented AJAX uploadResize option to allow resizing an image
      before upload (onli)

    * Improved file/directory removal code to (hopefully) fail more
      gracefully

    * Change "default" admin backend template fallback chain so that
      old admin themes can theoretically be shown with the "old"
      admin interface. This however in many themes breaks the 
      Serendipity workflow. In other words, currently old custom backend
      themes are deprecated. We are still working on how to deal
      with this and if we can add some sort of compatibility or port.

    * Fix bundled jquery's source mapping, upgraded to 1.11.1

    * Fixed missing media name in resize GET URL

    * Fix MediaDB overlay display

    * Re-Added possibility to change filename/target directory for
      media uploads

    * Update CKEditor to 4.4     

    * Fixed some missing internationalization instances

    * Minor CSS improvements for upgrader, plugin sequencing widget

    * RSS importer accepts pubDate in addition to pubdate element.

    * Upgrader in Dashboard can be disabled, returns error message when
      URL not accessible

    * Added a category filtering ability for the entry editor

    * Better check when removing old/dead files to prevent error
      messages

    * WYSIWYG editor respects image floats

    * Support html5 multiple file upload

    * Modernizr, magnificPopup updates

    * Improvements to equal heights js, button labels

    * No longer truncate long entry titles

    * Improve non-WYSIWYG editor tag insertion, url insertion

    * Improve less DOM firing on certain javascript tasks

    * Introduce js_backend event hook

Version 2.0-beta1 and followup -beta2 (April 14th, 2014)
------------------------------------------------------------------------


    * Upgrade Smarty libs to 3.1.18

    * Automatic upgrade removal of old Smarty2 files (2.0-alpha2)
      function uses SPL

    * Implemented patch https://github.com/s9y/Serendipity/pull/15

    * When switching Themes, both the backend and the frontend
      will remember the timestamp of the last theme change,
      to make sure that the browser will not cache a mismatching CSS.

    * Fix theme change issues with global template vars in core 
      (1559472ca3) see 'temporary added empty $template_config_groups' 
      in 1.7-rc2 (eb77dc369a)

    * Use Smarty for backend display output

    * "Themes" are now what has previously been mixed as "Design", 
      "Theme", "Template" or "Layouts".

    * WYSIWYG-Spawn-API reworked (2k11/admin/wysiwyg_init.tpl)

    * All Javascript-functions like SetCookie now reside in a 
      serendipity-object, simulating a namespace.
        SetCookie(...)
      became
        serendipity.SetCookie(...)

    * Renamed JS-Function:
        toggleCategorySelector became toggle_category_selector

    * The advanced js option (eyecandy) got removed, as such a thing 
      like advanced js doesn't exist anymore

    * dashboard_plugin has an equivalent in the core, replacing the 
      frontpage

    * Constants like S9Y_FRAMEWORK_COMPAT are no longer set 
      (include_once is used instead)

    * New additional option to render smarty-functions: 
      serendipity_smarty_show($template, $data)

    * A number of functions now returns their result instead of echoing 
      them (TODO: a bunch of image- and
      trackback-functions still use echo for messages"):
        serendipity_plugin_config
        serendipity_printEntryForm
        serendipity_printEntries
        function serendipity_showMedia
        serendipity_showPropertyForm
        showMediaLibrary
        serendipity_guessInput
        memSnap
        serendipity_displayTopUrlList
        serendipity_displayTopExits
        serendipity_displayTopReferrers
        serendipity_printConfigTemplate
        show_plugins

    * Functions removed from the core:
        serendipity_printConfigJS

    * Functions added to the core:
        serendipity_generateImageSelectorParams

    * All internal plugins got extracted from plugin_internal.inc.php 
      and moved to plugins/.
      They are renamed to work there (upgrader task provides migration):
        serendipity_calendar_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_calendar
        serendipity_quicksearch_plugin became serendipity_plugin_quicksearch
        serendipity_archives_plugin    became serendipity_plugin_archives
        serendipity_categories_plugin  became serendipity_plugin_categories
        serendipity_syndication_plugin became serendipity_plugin_syndication
        serendipity_superuser_plugin   became serendipity_plugin_superuser
        serendipity_plug_plugin        became serendipity_plugin_plug

    * Add plugin hook "js", generating a virtual serendipity.js

    * Admin JS is now bundled in serendipity_editor.js.tpl and 
      rendered using smarty in the theme config

    * Admin JS got rewritten using jQuery where applicable

    * serendipity_define.js.php removed

    * Removed support for layout.php

    * The whole PHP-Code now almost never echoes integrated HTML, but 
      uses smarty template (TODO: Remove the almost)
      The necessary smarty-templates reside in 2k11/admin/
      Every theme can generate its own backend if it integrates those 
      templates under admin/ itself

    * 2k11 is set as the new default backend, replacing bulletproof. 
      default remains the fallback so far.

    * A number of functions had some arguments removed:
        * function serendipity_displayImageList:
            From
                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL, $smarty_display = true)
            to
                function serendipity_displayImageList($page = 0, $lineBreak = NULL, $manage = false, $url = NULL, $show_upload = false, $limit_path = NULL)
        * function serendipity_showMedia
            From
                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array(), $smarty_display = true)
            to
                function serendipity_showMedia(&$file, &$paths, $url = '', $manage = false, $lineBreak = 3, $enclose = true, $smarty_vars = array())
        * generate_plugins
            From
                static function generate_plugins($side, $tag = '', $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')
            to
                static function generate_plugins($side, $negate = false, $class = null, $id = null, $tpl = 'sidebar.tpl')

    * serendipity_showMedia now no longer returns the used template and 
      echoes the generated HTML, but only returns the generated HTML

    * Themes now have their own configuration page, 
      ?serendipity[adminModule]=templates&serendipity[adminAction]=editConfiguration

    * jQuery in the backend no longer runs in noConflict-mode. Use 
      $(...) instead of jQuery(...)

    * The entryproperty-plugin will now always delete its cache on 
      uninstall, not only if the cache is activated then

    * serendipity_is_iframe now really only checks for iframe and 
      doesn't also echo it

    * Added option simpleFilters (meant to indicate to show less 
      filters and poweruser-options)

    * serendipity_admin_image_selector.php no longer used by 2k11, 
      instead the media library (with admin/media_choose.tpl, 
      admin/media_upload.tpl, media_pane.tpl, media_items.tpl)
      can generat the imageselector on its own. The editor calls 
      serendipity_admin.php?serendipity[adminModule]=media instead, 
      with serendipity[textarea] indicating the target, and
      serendipity[showMediaToolbar] activating the imageSelector modus
      
    * New required PHP-Version: 5.3 or higher (checked in the installer)

Version 1.7.8 (February 9th, 2014)

        - XSS of users realname in "Manage users" section
          (Backend, requires login)
        - XSS when creating an entry with bad id/timestamp values
          (Backend, requires login)
        - SQL-Injection for plugin installation parameter
          (Backend, requires admin login)

    * Templatechooser plugin uses "default" template as fallback,
      not "bulletproof".

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * rc4: Get ready for CKEDITOR-wysiwyg Plugin mode

    * rc4: Fixed fetching javascript object (for nugget textareas) in non-wysiwyg-mode

    * rc4: Change .htaccess blocking mechanism by spamblock plugin to not fetch
      too many datarows, thanks to DLange from the forums. (The .htaccess
      feature is still considered experimental, use at your own risk ;))

    * rc4: Fixed entryproperties backend 'cache now' link

    * rc3 + rc4: Media database: Escape more Cookie values to prevent storing
      possible XSS (http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19142).
      Escape hotlinked media filename. Escape importer host name error
      Thanks to GreenSun from the forums for bringing this to attention,
      originally reported by Dshellnoi Unix

    * rc2: Alter entries.tpl to add the line:
      {assign var="entry" value=$entry scope="parent"}
      for proper propagation of $entry to sub-templates.

    * rc2: Alter error reporting to only fail when 'debug' mode is enabled,
      so that "normal" blog installations will not fail on specific
      E_STRICT warnings that are not important.

    * rc2: temporary added empty $template_config_groups into templates with config,
      to avoid display troubles for template changes, if previous template had these set.

    * rc2: reflect POST submitted changes in Bulletproof template configs re-set situations 

    * various PHP 5 compatibility fixes in core and plugins

    * Allow entryproperties plugin to define defaults for custom fields

    * Onyx, Net_URL classes: Remove PHP4 style constructor due to
      PHP5 error "Constructor already defined"

    * Improved RSS sidebarplugin to support Atom 

    * Bundled simplepie

    * For Blogs running on a non-UTF-8 language, set a Smarty constant
      to indicate the actually used charset.

    * Added to use MyISAM handler for s9y tables (we do not use InnoDB
      features, but rely on MyISAM fulltext)

    * fixed defaultBaseURL did not show up installer. Thanks to onli.
      Follow up from c292bad

    * fixed draft & future entries preview link in backend

    * Improved karmarating plugin to be able to use AJAX calls
      (gregman)

    * Allow Smarty to fetch .tpl files from all directories so that
      s9y plugin can use the fetch() call for their .tpl files no
      matter which (symlinked) directory the plugin resides in.
      The Smarty security policy to us only serves as a restriction
      within .tpl files to not allow arbitrary PHP modifier/function calls.
      If in the future Smarty supports enforcing trustedDir checks on
      {include} calls seperately to smarty->fetch() calls, we'll also
      add that to .tpl files.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Patch by Markus Brükner: Properly handle files that have no
      extension in media database

    * Made Spartacus recognize github.com mirror (garvinhicking)
    
    * Add "Summary" output to title of summary archive pages, patch by
      hboeck
 
    * Set the smarty object by instance (ophian)
      It is often needed to access the Smarty object from anywhere in your code, e.g. in plugins
      We now ensure that there is only one instance of the object available.
      To obtain an instance of this class: $serendipity['smarty'] = Serendipity_Smarty::getInstance();
      The first time this is called a new instance will be created. Thereafter, the same instance is handed back.
      To overwrite use $serendipity['smarty'] = new Serendipity_Smarty; to create a new instance.
    
    * Set a global Serendipity errorToExceptionHandler (ophian)
      changed some old smarty trigger_errors to PHPs native function
    
    * Updated spamblock plugin (ophian)
      changed wordfilter to function and Commenters moderation check verify_once 
      to get checked via wordfilter to reject known spam comments before
    
    * Changed backend comment (error) messages  (ophian)
      as now captured and styleable messages
      (newly added .serendipity_backend_msg_notice css class)

    * Updated nl2br plugin (ophian)
      added isolation tag using nl to br
      this also adds some NoBR buttons to backend entry forms
    
    * Smarty3 support (ophian)
      with this upgrade Serendipity / Smarty will at least need a webserver running the PHP 5.2 series.
      As of August 2011, all PHP users should note, that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore by the PHP developers. 
      All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.8 and up. Please refer to your ISP about this.
    
    * Added new serendipity['defaultBaseURL'] variable that makes sure
      that the baseURL is not overriden when configuring serendipity
      with a possibly autodetected currentl URL. Patch by Manko10.

Version 1.6.2 (May 16th, 2012)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix SQL injection for comment.php used in read-context.
      (Thanks to High-Tech Bridge SA Security Release Lab, Advisory HTB23092)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    * Improved escaping of backend plugin management for DB query
      and media selector output (Stefan Schurtz)

    * Updated spamblock plugin to 1.78 & 1.79 (backport)
      changed wordfilter to function to check with 'verify_once'
      to reject wordfilter signed spam comments before -
          added in 1.79 killswitch check and serendipity_db_bool()

    * fixed draft & future entries preview link in backend (backport)

    * Fixed some possible errors with pdo db_begin/end_transaction()

    * Fixed unneccessary preg_match notices in the statistics backend

    * Fixed a possible problem where template-specific variables would
      not be cleared in favor of the new global ones.

    * Fixed serendipity_fetchComments producing wrong SQL code. Please
      check your code if you did workarounds already and remove them.
      
Version 1.6 (October 27th 2011)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix XSS issue in mediadatabase and karma
      filtering, thanks to Stefan Schurtz

    * Fix problem with autosave plugin used in conjunction with
      entryproperties (chrisbra)
      
    * Removed browsercompatibilitty plugin because it's outdated and
      IE6 shall be dead.
      
    * Fixed Spartauc SF.Net download location (Thanks to christian_boltz)
    
    * Added new event hook 'backend_loginfail' to track failed logins
      (serendipity_event_externalauth can make use of it for fail2ban)
      
    * Fixed a bug in synchronizing new files with the same basename
      but different extensions, where files with the same mimetype
      would not get added (garvinhicking)

    * Show subscription status of comments in frontend and backend
    
    * Added ability to report spam/ham to akismet (Black Warthog)
    
    * Added localization for {$WEBLOG} in trackbacks.tpl (LazyBadger)
    
    * Added "Options -MultiViews" to .htaccess to prevent IE9 trouble
    
    * Karma plugin: Added option to only track votings when users are
      logged in.
      
    * Bugfix: Adjust /admin permalink detection so that it does not listen
      on /adminbook for example. Thanks to Lux!
      
    * serendipity_event_mailer now also allows to use commas instead of 
      spaces to seperate multiple mails. Use distinct email adresses
      (Thanks to evanslee)
      
    * Added new rewrite option for 1&1 specific servers, because a 
      combined htaccess for both variants could not be find. The reason
      is the MultiViews option in certain apache configs.
      
    * Fix PDO::SQLite to properly fetch the requested row type
      (assoc/both/num), important for staticpage plugin

      (garvinhicking)
      
    * Added new parameter "empty" to {serendipity_showPlugin}. When
      no callable plugins were found, the string in the "empty" parameter

           empty="Twitter plugin not found!"}

      serendipity_loadGlobalThemeOptions($template_config, $template_loaded_config, $template_global_config);

      will automatically detect.

      You can also (additionally) add a property bag attribute "website" inside
      your plugin's introspect() method:

      $propbag->add('website', 'http://anypage.com/');

      To provide a version history, you can add a file "ChangeLog" (mind the exact

    * Small bugfixes: Allow to use different login credentials than the

      single entry view (garvinhicking)

    * Added bookmarklet to Serendipity core, added to the "Further links"
      welcome screen. Thanks to stm999999999! (garvinhicking)

    * Fixed a bug in lowercased DB key names in the plugin API table,
      which prevented postgresql for properly printing a plugin list
      in some setups (garvinhicking)

    * Huge SQL improvement by "caching" the current timestamp for
      5 minutes, so that an SQL string for the central logic will
      stay the same for a 5 minute window, thus relying on the DB-Server
      to cache query results more efficiently. Major thanks to
      Matthew Groeninger.

    * Enhanced nl2br plugin so that it will NOT put breaks into pre-

    * Support to delete multiple entries at once via checkboxes in the
      entry admin panel, fix admin entry pagination to not show
      next pages, if that next page were empty. (garvinhicking)

Version 1.1-beta5 (October 18th, 2006)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Added new plugin hooks:
        backend_templates_configuration_top
        backend_templates_configuration_bottom
        backend_templates_configuration_none
      for the theme configuration (garvinhicking)

    * Allow to set $serendipity['CacheControl'] to make serendipity emit
      Cache-Control: HTTP headers. Thanks to annonymous from the forums!

    * Use seperate PHP session ID when using HTTPS login. Set 'secure'
      cookie parameters when using HTTPS. Thanks to lynoure!

    * Added possibility for templates to define the sidebars they use.
      The template specifies this via the $template_config array in
      the config.inc.php file of a template. It looks like this:
       $template_config = array(
         array(
           'var'     => 'sidebars',
           'title'   => 'Sidebars',
           'type'    => 'string',
           'default' => 'left,hide,right'
         )
       );
      Note some things: Seperate the sidebar keys with a "," only -
      do not use spaces. Also never use more than 6 characters for
      the descriptors.
      If you do not want to make it configurable, you can also use
      the $serendipity['sidebars'] array to define the sidebars
      that are available.

      permission restrictions (garvinhicking)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Change permalinks to allow "%" in URLS. Fix templatedropdown
      plugin to remove double "//". Fix bad htmlspecialchars of the
      RDF ident link. (garvinhicking)

    * Allow to apply current permissions of a directory to all sub-
      directories (Matthew Groeninger)

    * Fix a bug in the HTTP 304 Conditional GET RSS-Feed caching when
      the server timezone offset was not set to zero. Thanks to dand!

    * Added ability to use HTTP Authentication to the blog. Can be
      triggered by submitting HTTP Auth credentials [only supported when
      the server runs with mod_php, not as CGI]. Authentication can be
      forced URLs with the "?http_auth=true" parameter, which
      will then send a "401 Unauthorized" header.
      If your server does not support mod_php, you can submit REQUEST
      variables: ?http_auth_user=XXX&http_auth_pw=YYY.
      Note that specifying username and password in the URI will lead
      to password disclosure in HTTP logfiles.
      This feature is most importantly meant for RSS-feeds, to make
      RSS readers able to submit login credentials. (garvinhicking)

Version 1.1-beta1 (August 14th, 2006)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix multiple loading of $serendipity['smarty'] theme options when
      calling serendipity_smarty_init() more than once. Many thanks to
      Sven Ediger for reporting this. (garvinhicking)

    * Properly sort media directories (garvinhicking)

    * Better use of "return by references" in some vital areas.
      Improves performance. Might introduce glitches. Keep an eye on this!
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add new template 'comments_by_author' which show comments made
      by authors. New permalink structure:
       "/comments/[AUTHORNAME]/comments|trackbacks|comments_and_trackbacks/P[PAGENUMBER]/FROM [YYYY-MM-DD]/TO [YYYY-MM-DD]"
      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also use /F and /T.
      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also specify /last_X, where X
      is the amount of past days to show comments for.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add "Comments and Trackbacks" feed feature (stm99..)

    * Add LiveJournal XML importer (garvinhicking)

    * Fix not fetching allow_comments/moderate_comments value when
      inside search function. Thanks to stm! (garvinhicking)

    * Add new links to check for upgradable SPARTACUS plugins
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add new frontend view "Archive by Authors": /archive/Axx.html to
      view the archive listing for specific authors only (like viewing
      archive by specific categories only via /archive/Cxx.html etc.)
      (garvinhicking)

    * Templating: Add new {$entry.html_title} variable that holds
      unescaped HTML code of the Entry's title (garvinhicking)

    * BC-Break / Plugin API change: The serendipity_getTemplate() file
      now no longer returns FALSE when a file is not found, but instead
      the filename without a path. This is required so that the smarty-
      created error message contains the missing filename instead of an
      empty '' string.
      Plugins based on this function need to make sure that they will
      now properly use a file_exists() check on the returned function,
      if they want to probe different locations of a file.
      All template files containing the string "plugin" will still return
      FALSE for the function call, to circumvent problems with spartacus
      plugins.
      Bottom line: Plugins that use "*plugin*.tpl" filenames or check
      via file_exists() on the returned variable are safe.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add patch to allow entryproperties plugin to define passwords for

      include/template_api.inc.php file. Dedicated to Davey. ;)
      (garvinhicking)

    * Support to crop images from within the media database. Pick a
      picture in the MDB, go to the property section of that image
      and click on the "EDIT" link. (garvinhicking)

        TODO:
            - Operate also on PNG, TIFF etc. (currently only JPEG!)
            - Support image magick (currently ony gdlib!)
            - Currently backup files are scattered around, fix this.
            - Interface cleanup

      heavily customized output. (garvinhicking)

      Thanks to Markus Brueckner! (garvinhicking)

     manager when having JS disabled! (garvinhicking)

    * Inserting links via the Serendipity Toolbar over the entry area
      now also asks for a link tooltip/title.

    * Plugin API no longer queries the filename of a plugin if it is internal
      (increases performance because of less SQL queries) (garvinhicking)

    * Onyx RSS parser now uses PEAR::HTTP_Request instead of fopen wrappers
      to work on allow_url_fopen disabled hosts. Plugins like remoterss and
      aggregator can now properly fetch RSS feeds on those hosts.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Make "/archive" view also recognize selected category. Sidebar
      archive and calendar plugins also pay strict attention to which
      category is selected. Helps "semi-multiple" blogs based on categories
      a lot. (garvinhicking)

    * Make media insertion dialog remember settings (via Cookies) and
      insert return of the media database on cursor position.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Admin comment panels shows comments with their content and escaped HTML
      instead of stripping all HTML. Only summary, if longer than 200 characters
      will have stripped HTML because of otherwise invalid markup. (garvinhicking)

    * Updated statistics plugin to track seperate visitor/referrer statistics.
      Patch by Fredrik Sandberg, thanks a lot! (garvinhicking)

    * Make category selector be nicer to Opera. Load the handling functions
      only after the DOM load is completed. Add new "addLoadEvent"
      functionality for future use to stack onload events. (garvinhicking)

    * New Plugin API Hook "frontend_calendar" which allows to hook into
      sidebar calendar creation. Needs to be enabled in the calendar
      plugin configuration and needs a patch to the plugin_calendar.tpl
      file which is done in all bundled themes. (Anthem)

    * Atom 1.0 feed support (garvinhicking)

    * MoveableType importer now also recognizes comments and trackbacks.
      Tested with MT 3.17. (garvinhicking)

    * Make template directory allow to contain subdirectories with more
      templates. This allows you to symbolically link the "additional_themes"
      CVS directory within your templates path, just like you can do
      with the "additional_plugins" directory already (garvinhicking)

    * Allow UTF-8 recoding using mb_* functions (Tadashi Jokagi)

    * Allow to switch charsets ("Native" / "UTF-8"). (garvinhicking)

    * Permissions: The permission "adminImagesViewOthers" now controls
      whether an author is allowed to view images or not. In older Serendipity
      versions, any author could always view any images, but only modify those
      belonging to him. (garvinhicking)

    * Plugin API: Added plugin hooks for category properties, made smarty
      init function accept plugin values. See the plugin "Properties for
      Categories" for example usage. The plugin allows to create sub-blogs
      based on categories (garvinhicking)

    * Categories plugin can be configured to only show specific sub-
      categories and hide other categories when descending the tree
      (garvinhicking)

    * "Edit entries" panel can now delete entries and returns to the
      originating panel. Also it now utilizes Cookies (via JS) to remember
      the last used settings (sortorder, filters) (garvinhicking)

    * Added WordPress-PostgreSQL importer, by Devrim Gunduz

    * RFE #1231423: Allow to change the author of an entry with the
      "entryproperties" plugin. (garvinhicking)

    * Plugin Manager: Improve Spartacus interface and include plugin
      categories (garvinhicking)

    * Support different WYSIWYG editors via new plugin hooks. TinyMCE
      plugin available. (garvinhicking)

    * Allow language files to define $i18n_filename_from and _to array
      so that each language can individually rewrite URL characters.
      Only the Russian language currently makes use of this.
      (garvinhicking)

    * fixed serendipity_traversePath() -  PHP5 issue with array_merge()
      Thanks to jdhawk for the fix (flotsam)

    * fixed wrong display of "found X entries matching your search" in

      Bugs #1226440, #1226439 (garvinhicking)

    * Fix multi-category selector for Konqueror (garvinhicking)

    * Support use of Boolean search mode in MySQL. Is activated when using

      (garvinhicking)

    * Apply patch to allow usage of Feedburner RSS feeds, by Anders Clerwall

      URLs. (garvinhicking)

    * Introduce permission groups with customizable permission sets.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Make bblog importer recognize trackbacks. Thanks to Hanno!

    * Spartacus plugin can now properly handle plugins which contain both
      sidebar and event plugins in one directory (garvinhicking)

    * TEMPLATES: Added div.serendipity_section_(comments|trackbacks|commentform)
      containers inside the Default Template's entries.tpl file to be
      able to customize certain containers via CSS.
      Solves RFE #1210889 (garvinhicking)

    * TEMPLATES: Added div.serendipity_search_* wrapping elements to be
      able to style the search result messages specifically. Added new

      translation by Posz Marton

      Patch by Omid Mottaghi

    * New personal configuration item: "Forbid creating entries" to
      allow authors to be logged in, but not create any entries. Meant
      to be used in conjunction with serendipity_plugin_adduser for
      user self-registration where you want to allow posting comments
      to registered users only. (garvinhicking)

    * Added Custom Permalink URL days, months, years, etc. to the
      Serendipity Configuration ("Paths") panel.
      If you use the external plugin serendipity_plugin_authors or
      serendipity_event_linktoolbar, you need to update those to
      their latest versions to work with the new changes.
      (garvinhicking, tomsommer)

    * Importers can now properly import data if the source database is
      not the same as the target database (garvinhicking)

    * Use $smarty.const. to access constants instead of $CONST within
      Smarty templates; this is replaced using a Smarty prefilter, so
      that within templates you can still use the $CONST shortcut
      (garvinhicking)

    * Added new event hook to the trackback sending facility so that
      plugins like serendipity_event_trackback (additional_plugins)
      can send trackbacks to Blogs without RDF-metadata (garvinhicking)

    * Allow to view and fetch multiple categories. Categories plugin
      can allow viewers to select multiple categories to view.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Added hooks into the image selector admin popup for plugins to
      support additional options. serendipity_event_imageselectorplus
      accesses those hooks already. (garvinhicking)

    * Categories plugin now offers to sort by category name, description
      or creation date. (garvinhicking)

    * Give HTML Nugget the option for a second "description" attribute
      that is used in the Plugin Configuration section, so that HTML
      nuggets with an empty title still display additional information
      to distinct multiple nuggets from another (garvinhicking)

    * New entryproperties plugin option: Hide an entry from the frontpage
      (garvinhicking)

      (garvinhicking)

Version 0.8.5 (September 29th, 2005)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * More Security: When changing the password in your personal preferences,
      you need to insert the old password. Secure backend forms with extra
      token checks to bypass XSRF attacks. Thanks to Nenad Jovanovic for
      contacting me about this issue! (garvinhicking)

    * Fix JS errors in admin comment overview for IE6 (garvinhicking)

    * Fix showing any entry-id related sidebar plugins, when a selected
      entry is not visible (permissions/drafts/...) by unsetting the
      global $serendipity['GET']['id'] in that case. (garvinhicking)

    * Fix "DATA_TRACKBACK_APPROVED" showing of constants when approving
      trackbacks/comments instead of the properly formatted message.
      (Would've required a template change for a "pretty solution", but
       the current fix is a BC-compatible fix by defining constants a bit
       differently) (garvinhicking)

    * Default Admin Stylesheet no longer uses direct height: assignment,
      but padding instead. This should get rid of occasional overlapping
      of menu items. Thanks a lot to Ognyan Kulev for the solution to this!

    * Fix putting sticky entry on the last page in postgreSQL setups.
      Thanks to Nate Johnston for working this out! (garvinhicking)

    * Fix file upload bug which limited upload filesize to 3 million bytes
      (2.86MB) regardless of PHP configuration. Maximum upload filesize
      should now be properly bound by PHP configuration settings.
      (wesley)

    * Fix cosmetic warning message about missing S9Y_PEAR_PATH when
      installing. (garvinhicking)

Version 0.8.4 (August 19th, 2005)

      large sizing in Internet Explorer. Thanks to frodeste from the
      Forums!

    * Hide title of an entry in the frontend, if entry is draft and not
      displayed. Fixes Bug #1260667 (garvinhicking)

    * Unbundle Serendipity XML-RPC functions from the bundled distribution.
      You will now need to install the additional plugin "Post via XML-RPC"
      (serendipity_event_xmlrpc) to make entry posts via this interface.
      The ongoing security issues with this interface and the little usage
      of this functionality by the broad public have forced this move.
      After installing this plugin you can use the same URL and nothing
      will change for XML-RPC users. (garvinhicking)

   * Optionally allow using a local PEAR installation. Set
     $serendipity['use_PEAR'] = true
     in your serendipity_config_local.inc.php or serendipity_config.inc.php
     file. The required packages can be found in the
     bundled-libs/.current_version file. (garvinhicking)

   * Append the comment id to the mail that is sent to subscribers of
     an entry, so that they can jump to the submitted comment immediately.
     (garvinhicking)

   * Make categories sidebar plugin show categories' description, not the
     name on mouse over (garvinhicking)

   * Added new config option "blogMail" that specifies the blog's used
     From: E-Mail address. If not given, falls back to not specifying
     From: field and using mailserver default ("wwwrun", "nobody", ...)
     (garvinhicking)

   * Fix possible exploit that sends comments to the blog owner and others
     with arbitrary mailheaders and a link to invalid entries. Thanks to
     Sebastian Raible! (garvinhicking)

   * Allow plugins to contain more than one HTML nuggets which can be
     WYSIWYGized. (garvinhicking)

     to the files entries_archives.tpl and entries_summary.tpl:
      {serendipity_hookPlugin hook="entries_header"}
      <div class='serendipity_entryFooter' style="text-align: center">
        {serendipity_hookPlugin hook="entries_footer"}
      </div>
     (wesley)

    * Increased level of output message from the Spartacus plugin

    * Patched XML-RPC functions, thanks to Tim Putnam. This should enable
      XML-RPC services to properly fetch existing articles and edit them.

    * Fix Plugin API call performing too many unneeded SQL queries
      (garvinhicking)

    * Fix missing authorname when previewing entry. Thanks to winkiller,

    * Fix RSS 1.0 missing top-level namespace (garvinhicking)

    * Deactivated gzip compression by default, as in certain server

    * Allow the serendipity_event_trackback additional trackbacks plugin
      to send trackbacks even if your entry did not contain at least one

      default, kubrick and wp templates (sidebar.tpl) (garvinhicking)

    * Fix error "Warning: ob_start(): output handler 'ob_gzhandler'
      cannot be used after 'URL-Rewriter'" which can occur on installations
      where session.use_trans_sid is activated and Serendipity's gzip
      compression is used. (garvinhicking)

      Windows servers. Thanks to BobRock! (garvinhicking)

    * BBCode plugin: Allow =, ~ and ! URL characters (garvinhicking)

      proper cachability for Conditional Get (garvinhicking)

    * Fix issues on Windows installations: %T strftime-Option not known
      when saving a plugin and emitting timestamp (was empty),
      redirecting to a wrong URL for installation with '\' instead of

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.8-beta3/4 (March 15th, 2005)

    * RSS / Syndication plugin now offers to hide E-Mail adresses from

    * Make RSS import parse ISO-8601 dates (like
      '2004-11-24T22:43:08-05:00'), as PHPs strtotime() does not parse

      using bandwidth from your own server. Media files can now also
      be searched by name. Thanks to Chris Chan for this feature!

      name seen by readers of the blog. The username is now only used for
      logging into the administration suite (tomsommer)

      a dropdown instead of needing to edit a Serendipity core file.
      (garvinhicking)

    * New configuration directive to tell Serendipity if the baseURL
      shall be autodetected. This can be useful if you use multiple
      domainnames listening on one blog installation. (Note: This auto-
      detection was previously already enabled if using 'embedded mode')
      (garvinhicking)

    * Fixed bug for postgreSQL: Comments for entries within multiple
      categories showed up as many times as the entry was within multiple
      categories. Thanks to rickmans from the forums for detecting this.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Remember last state of media library (sort order, files per page,
      directory, sortfield), via JavaScript+Cookies (garvinhicking)

    * The config option 'extCSS' has been removed. It is now re-
      commended to set external stylesheets in the template's index.tpl
      file, or to @import it within the templates style.css file.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Personal Configuration allows to set defaults for creating new
      entries (allow comments, moderate comments, publish/draft)
