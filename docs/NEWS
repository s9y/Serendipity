------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * rc4: Get ready for CKEDITOR-wysiwyg Plugin mode

    * rc4: Fixed fetching javascript object (for nugget textareas) in non-wysiwyg-mode

    * Change .htaccess blocking mechanism by spamblock plugin to not fetch
      too many datarows, thanks to DLange from the forums. (The .htaccess
      feature is still considered experimental, use at your own risk ;))

    * rc4: Fixed entryproperties backend 'cache now' link

    * Media database: Escape more Cookie values to prevent storing
      possible XSS (http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=19142).
      Escape hotlinked media filename. Escape importer host name error
      Thanks to GreenSun from the forums for bringing this to attention,
      originally reported by Dshellnoi Unix

    * rc2: Alter entries.tpl to add the line:
      {assign var="entry" value=$entry scope="parent"}
      for proper propagation of $entry to sub-templates.

    * rc2: Alter error reporting to only fail when 'debug' mode is enabled,
      so that "normal" blog installations will not fail on specific
      E_STRICT warnings that are not important.

    * rc2: temporary added empty $template_config_groups into templates with config,
      to avoid display troubles for template changes, if previous template had these set.
      Please check your template.

    * rc2: reflect POST submitted changes in Bulletproof template configs re-set situations 

    * various PHP 5 compatibility fixes in core and plugins

    * Allow entryproperties plugin to define defaults for custom fields

    * Onyx, Net_URL classes: Remove PHP4 style constructor due to
      PHP5 error "Constructor already defined"

    * Improved RSS sidebarplugin to support Atom 

    * Bundled simplepie

    * For Blogs running on a non-UTF-8 language, set a Smarty constant
      to indicate the actually used charset. 

    * Added to use MyISAM handler for s9y tables (we do not use InnoDB
      features, but rely on MyISAM fulltext)
      
    * fixed defaultBaseURL did not show up installer. Thanks to onli.
      Follow up from c292bad

    * fixed draft & future entries preview link in backend

    * Improved karmarating plugin to be able to use AJAX calls
      (gregman)

    * Allow Smarty to fetch .tpl files from all directories so that
      s9y plugin can use the fetch() call for their .tpl files no
      matter which (symlinked) directory the plugin resides in.
      The Smarty security policy to us only serves as a restriction
      within .tpl files to not allow arbitrary PHP modifier/function calls.
      If in the future Smarty supports enforcing trustedDir checks on
      {include} calls seperately to smarty->fetch() calls, we'll also
      add that to .tpl files.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Patch by Markus Brükner: Properly handle files that have no
      extension in media database

    * Made Spartacus recognize github.com mirror (garvinhicking)
    
    * Add "Summary" output to title of summary archive pages, patch by
      hboeck
 
    * Set the smarty object by instance (ophian)
      It is often needed to access the Smarty object from anywhere in your code, e.g. in plugins
      We now ensure that there is only one instance of the object available.
      To obtain an instance of this class: $serendipity['smarty'] = Serendipity_Smarty::getInstance();
      The first time this is called a new instance will be created. Thereafter, the same instance is handed back.
      To overwrite use $serendipity['smarty'] = new Serendipity_Smarty; to create a new instance.
    
    * Set a global Serendipity errorToExceptionHandler (ophian)
      changed some old smarty trigger_errors to PHPs native function
    
    * Updated spamblock plugin (ophian)
      changed wordfilter to function and Commenters moderation check verify_once 
      to get checked via wordfilter to reject known spam comments before
    
    * Changed backend comment (error) messages  (ophian)
      as now captured and styleable messages
      (newly added .serendipity_backend_msg_notice css class)

    * Updated nl2br plugin (ophian)
      added isolation tag using nl to br
      this also adds some NoBR buttons to backend entry forms
    
    * Smarty3 support (ophian)
      with this upgrade Serendipity / Smarty will at least need a webserver running the PHP 5.2 series.
      As of August 2011, all PHP users should note, that the PHP 5.2 series is NOT supported anymore by the PHP developers. 
      All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade to PHP 5.3.8 and up. Please refer to your ISP about this.
    
    * Added new serendipity['defaultBaseURL'] variable that makes sure
      that the baseURL is not overriden when configuring serendipity
      with a possibly autodetected currentl URL. Patch by Manko10.

      to reject wordfilter signed spam comments before -
          added in 1.79 killswitch check and serendipity_db_bool()

    * Show subscription status of comments in frontend and backend
    
    * Added ability to report spam/ham to akismet (Black Warthog)

      on /adminbook for example. Thanks to Lux!
      
    * serendipity_event_mailer now also allows to use commas instead of 
      spaces to seperate multiple mails. Use distinct email adresses
      (Thanks to evanslee)
      
    * Added new rewrite option for 1&1 specific servers, because a 
      combined htaccess for both variants could not be find. The reason

      (garvinhicking)
      
    * Added new parameter "empty" to {serendipity_showPlugin}. When
      no callable plugins were found, the string in the "empty" parameter
      will be shown instead, allowing users to get notified of a missing

           class="serendipity_plugin_twitter"
           empty="Twitter plugin not found!"}

    * Bundle jquery by default and enable it in frontend and backend
      templates; overrides serendipity_event_jquery. If your template

      (garvinhicking)
    
    * Include API logic to allow the core to utilize event hooks with
      internal function calls (used for jquery output, for example)
      (garvinhicking)

      navigation configuration feature:
      
      $template_global_config = array('navigation' => true);
      serendipity_loadGlobalThemeOptions($template_config, $template_loaded_config, $template_global_config);
      
      More keys apart from "navigation" might get supported in the future.
      

    * Implemented suggestion of removing boilerplate code in plugin API:

      http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=16921

    * To support custom PHP sessions, s9y will only issue session_start,
      if no session exists yet (garvinhicking)

      of such groups are excluded from common author listings.
      (Ref http://board.s9y.org/viewtopic.php?f=11&t=16237)
      (garvinhicking)

      plugins can be bundled within a template, without the need to

    * Made entrypropertie's password plugin form use "autocomplete=off"
      to prevent inserting badly stored passwords. Thanks to sbauer!
      [1.4-beta2]

    * Added full plugin name and links to documentation/changelog for
      plugins on installation and configuration [1.4-beta2]:

      You can provide Documentation for your plugins by supplying a local file
      called documentation_XX.html inside the plugin directory, which Serendipity
      will automatically detect.

      You can also (additionally) add a property bag attribute "website" inside
      your plugin's introspect() method:

      $propbag->add('website', 'http://anypage.com/');

      To provide a version history, you can add a file "ChangeLog" (mind the exact
      spelling) to your plugin directory.

      All three possible links are shown on the Serendipity interface when
      configuring or installing a plugin.

    * Added possibility for templates to define the sidebars they use.
      The template specifies this via the $template_config array in
      the config.inc.php file of a template. It looks like this:
       $template_config = array(
         array(
           'var'     => 'sidebars',
           'title'   => 'Sidebars',
           'type'    => 'string',
           'default' => 'left,hide,right'
         )
       );
      Note some things: Seperate the sidebar keys with a "," only -
      do not use spaces. Also never use more than 6 characters for
      the descriptors.
      If you do not want to make it configurable, you can also use
      the $serendipity['sidebars'] array to define the sidebars
      that are available.

Version 1.1-beta3 ()
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Change permalinks to allow "%" in URLS. Fix templatedropdown
      plugin to remove double "//". Fix bad htmlspecialchars of the
      RDF ident link. (garvinhicking)

    * Allow to apply current permissions of a directory to all sub-
      directories (Matthew Groeninger)

    * Fix a bug in the HTTP 304 Conditional GET RSS-Feed caching when
      the server timezone offset was not set to zero. Thanks to dand!

    * Added ability to use HTTP Authentication to the blog. Can be
      triggered by submitting HTTP Auth credentials [only supported when
      the server runs with mod_php, not as CGI]. Authentication can be
      forced URLs with the "?http_auth=true" parameter, which
      will then send a "401 Unauthorized" header.
      If your server does not support mod_php, you can submit REQUEST
      variables: ?http_auth_user=XXX&http_auth_pw=YYY.
      Note that specifying username and password in the URI will lead
      to password disclosure in HTTP logfiles.
      This feature is most importantly meant for RSS-feeds, to make
      RSS readers able to submit login credentials. (garvinhicking)

Version 1.1-beta1 (August 14th, 2006)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Fix multiple loading of $serendipity['smarty'] theme options when
      calling serendipity_smarty_init() more than once. Many thanks to
      Sven Ediger for reporting this. (garvinhicking)

    * Properly sort media directories (garvinhicking)

    * Better use of "return by references" in some vital areas.
      Improves performance. Might introduce glitches. Keep an eye on this!
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add new template 'comments_by_author' which show comments made
      by authors. New permalink structure:
       "/comments/[AUTHORNAME]/comments|trackbacks|comments_and_trackbacks/P[PAGENUMBER]/FROM [YYYY-MM-DD]/TO [YYYY-MM-DD]"
      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also use /F and /T.
      Instead of /FROM and /TO you can also specify /last_X, where X
      is the amount of past days to show comments for.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add "Comments and Trackbacks" feed feature (stm99..)

    * Add LiveJournal XML importer (garvinhicking)

    * Fix not fetching allow_comments/moderate_comments value when
      inside search function. Thanks to stm! (garvinhicking)

    * Add new links to check for upgradable SPARTACUS plugins
      (garvinhicking)

    * Add new frontend view "Archive by Authors": /archive/Axx.html to
      view the archive listing for specific authors only (like viewing
      archive by specific categories only via /archive/Cxx.html etc.)
      (garvinhicking)

    * Templating: Add new {$entry.html_title} variable that holds
      unescaped HTML code of the Entry's title (garvinhicking)

    * BC-Break / Plugin API change: The serendipity_getTemplate() file
      now no longer returns FALSE when a file is not found, but instead
      the filename without a path. This is required so that the smarty-
      created error message contains the missing filename instead of an
      empty '' string.
      Plugins based on this function need to make sure that they will
      now properly use a file_exists() check on the returned function,
      if they want to probe different locations of a file.
      All template files containing the string "plugin" will still return
      FALSE for the function call, to circumvent problems with spartacus
      plugins.
      Bottom line: Plugins that use "*plugin*.tpl" filenames or check
      via file_exists() on the returned variable are safe.
      (garvinhicking)

      (garvinhicking)

    * Add missing indices for the statistics visitor DB tables
      (garvinhicking)

      custom HTML/JS values. Current property bag value can be referenced
      by DOM GetElementById('config_plugin_XXX') if you want to emit
      specific JavaScript. Can also be used by template configurator for
      heavily customized output. (garvinhicking)

    * Fix bug #1494653: Non-Unique index constraint for 'exits' table.
      Thanks to Markus Brueckner! (garvinhicking)

   * Fix multiple occurences of the string "--" in the entry title to
     not mess up HTML display because of weird Firefox interpretation
     (Bug #1474290) (garvinhicking)

   * Made "fullfeed" syndication option also support "let the client
     decide", via $_GET['fullFeed'] = true/false. (garvinhicking)

   * Added new configuration option to that lets you toggle whether to
     comply with RFC2616 on Conditional GET. (Garvinhicking)

   * Support template/theme/style-specific options via "config.inc.php"

     could lead to arbitrary PHP code inclusion from

     Serendipity. Just create a plugins/preload.txt file containing
     the plugins to load (one plugin per line, indicate plugin type

     can be put into sql/preload.sql and may only contain INSERT
     statements. (garvinhicking, judebert)

     external admin plugins (garvinhicking)

   * Change karma plugin and search results to output more HTML span
     classes for better styling (garvinhicking)

   * Modified plugin API to allow deactivating the output of plugin
     sidebars (garvinhicking)

   * Patch bundled PEAR.php so that it does not try to declare a PEAR
     class a second time. (garvinhicking)

   * RSS feeds use the permalink URL to link to extended entry, not the

   * Remove duplicate path file name in serendipity_currentURL function,
     preventing the right "is frontpage?" detection routine from working.
     (garvinhicking)

   * Use mysql_real_escape_string when available (garvinhicking)

   * Atom feeds now use proper appliaction-mime type header, thanks to

     (garvinhicking)

   * Fix undefined function call to "is_defined".

   * Added translation helper tool plugin_lang.php to detect untranslated

     serendipity_fetchEntries() function call for further abstraction.
     (garvinhicking)

   * Add new plugin hook "backend_http_request" which passes PEAR
     HTTP_Request options to plugins for modification. $addData contains

     for WordPress 2.0 (garvinhicking)

   * Add new option to spamblock plugin to forbid trackbacks from URLs that
     don't have our URL in them. (garvinhicking)

   * Recognize "multiselect" as new plugin item type. Calls to get_config()

     array of multi-selected input values.
     For the property bag object, you can set a new item "select_preselected"
     to indicate which (if any) values shall be preselected. The item "select_size"

     (garvinhicking)

     (garvinhicking)

   * Fixed bug which broke thumbnail generation with Imagemagick when

     This allows to use HTTP redirects of trackbacks, which seem to
     get more common nowadays (garvinhicking)

     can override it (garvinhicking)

   * Added option to turn off referrer tracking (garvinhicking)

   * Improved Smarty Plugin API so that a new function
     serendipity_fetchPrintEntries() can be used within a template to
     print more entries, and abstracted _fetchEntries()/_printEntries()
     calls a bit more so that future plugins can easier modify the
     global $entries array and control smarty/plugin execution
     (garvinhicking)

   * Inserted phpDoc code documentation for all Serendipity functions
     (garvinhicking)

   * Made remote RSS plugin be able to emit debug messages, enhance

     characters (garvinhicking)

   * Spamblock plugin can block comments when they only contain the
     entry title (garvinhicking)

     that you can easily customize your feeds layouts, inject nagging
     ads and so on (garvinhicking)

   * Fix certain plugins to correctly behave when using entry-
     properties caching, by re-executing plugins that were not executed
     because they "scramble" the true content. (garvinhicking)

   * Introduced CUSTOM_ADMIN_INTERFACE that tells the user if the
     template author also made a stylesheet for the admin interface
     when selecting a theme (flotsam)

Version 0.9.2 ()

     instead of a generic locale. Fixes bug #1384978 (garvinhicking)

   * Fix entry quicksearch on postgresql, where it returned the same
     entry multiple times if it was contained in multiple categories.
     Fix by Robert Treat, many thanks!

     stylesheet, so that user-changes will be visible without manually
     purging the cache (garvinhicking)

   * Fix personal configuration no more able to lock you out of all
     user groups (garvinhicking)

   * File CSS stylesheets occasionally not returning the right path
     (garvinhicking)

------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * Change Onyx RSS parser and xml_parser_* functions to already specify

      (garvinhicking)

      method, used by the plugin configuration panel. Need to set "validate"
      and "validate_error" property bag attributes in your custom
      introspect_config_item() calls, documented on
      http://www.s9y.org/index.php?node=43#A13 (garvinhicking)

    * Read/Write permissions for user-groups for specific categories.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Reduce memory usage by splitting up function files, optimizing

      (garvinhicking)

    * Inserting links via the Serendipity Toolbar over the entry area

    * Plugin API no longer queries the filename of a plugin if it is internal
      (increases performance because of less SQL queries) (garvinhicking)

    * Onyx RSS parser now uses PEAR::HTTP_Request instead of fopen wrappers
      to work on allow_url_fopen disabled hosts. Plugins like remoterss and
      aggregator can now properly fetch RSS feeds on those hosts.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Make "/archive" view also recognize selected category. Sidebar
      archive and calendar plugins also pay strict attention to which
      category is selected. Helps "semi-multiple" blogs based on categories
      a lot. (garvinhicking)

      insert return of the media database on cursor position.
      (garvinhicking)

    * Admin comment panels shows comments with their content and escaped HTML
      instead of stripping all HTML. Only summary, if longer than 200 characters

    * Updated statistics plugin to track seperate visitor/referrer statistics.
      Patch by Fredrik Sandberg, thanks a lot! (garvinhicking)

    * Make category selector be nicer to Opera. Load the handling functions
      only after the DOM load is completed. Add new "addLoadEvent"
      functionality for future use to stack onload events. (garvinhicking)

    * New Plugin API Hook "frontend_calendar" which allows to hook into
      sidebar calendar creation. Needs to be enabled in the calendar
      plugin configuration and needs a patch to the plugin_calendar.tpl
      file which is done in all bundled themes. (Anthem)

    * Atom 1.0 feed support (garvinhicking)

    * MoveableType importer now also recognizes comments and trackbacks.
      Tested with MT 3.17. (garvinhicking)

      CVS directory within your templates path, just like you can do
      with the "additional_plugins" directory already (garvinhicking)

    * Allow UTF-8 recoding using mb_* functions (Tadashi Jokagi)

    * Allow to switch charsets ("Native" / "UTF-8"). (garvinhicking)

    * Permissions: The permission "adminImagesViewOthers" now controls
      whether an author is allowed to view images or not. In older Serendipity
      versions, any author could always view any images, but only modify those
      belonging to him. (garvinhicking)

    * Plugin API: Added plugin hooks for category properties, made smarty
      init function accept plugin values. See the plugin "Properties for
      Categories" for example usage. The plugin allows to create sub-blogs
      based on categories (garvinhicking)

    * Categories plugin can be configured to only show specific sub-
      categories and hide other categories when descending the tree
      (garvinhicking)

    * RFE #1231423: Allow to change the author of an entry with the

      so that each language can individually rewrite URL characters.
      Only the Russian language currently makes use of this.
      (garvinhicking)

    * fixed serendipity_traversePath() -  PHP5 issue with array_merge()
      Thanks to jdhawk for the fix (flotsam)

      containers inside the Default Template's entries.tpl file to be
      able to customize certain containers via CSS.
      Solves RFE #1210889 (garvinhicking)

      Patch by Omid Mottaghi

    * New personal configuration item: "Forbid creating entries" to
      allow authors to be logged in, but not create any entries. Meant
      to be used in conjunction with serendipity_plugin_adduser for
      user self-registration where you want to allow posting comments
      to registered users only. (garvinhicking)

    * Added Custom Permalink URL days, months, years, etc. to the
      Serendipity Configuration ("Paths") panel.
      If you use the external plugin serendipity_plugin_authors or
      serendipity_event_linktoolbar, you need to update those to
      their latest versions to work with the new changes.
      (garvinhicking, tomsommer)

    * Importers can now properly import data if the source database is
      not the same as the target database (garvinhicking)

    * Use $smarty.const. to access constants instead of $CONST within
      Smarty templates; this is replaced using a Smarty prefilter, so
      that within templates you can still use the $CONST shortcut
      (garvinhicking)

    * Added new event hook to the trackback sending facility so that
      plugins like serendipity_event_trackback (additional_plugins)
      can send trackbacks to Blogs without RDF-metadata (garvinhicking)

      can allow viewers to select multiple categories to view.
      (garvinhicking)

      or creation date. (garvinhicking)

    * Give HTML Nugget the option for a second "description" attribute

      (garvinhicking)

Version 0.8.5 (September 29th, 2005)
------------------------------------------------------------------------

    * More Security: When changing the password in your personal preferences,
      you need to insert the old password. Secure backend forms with extra
      token checks to bypass XSRF attacks. Thanks to Nenad Jovanovic for
      contacting me about this issue! (garvinhicking)

    * Fix JS errors in admin comment overview for IE6 (garvinhicking)

    * Fix showing any entry-id related sidebar plugins, when a selected
      entry is not visible (permissions/drafts/...) by unsetting the
      global $serendipity['GET']['id'] in that case. (garvinhicking)

    * Fix "DATA_TRACKBACK_APPROVED" showing of constants when approving
      trackbacks/comments instead of the properly formatted message.
      (Would've required a template change for a "pretty solution", but
       the current fix is a BC-compatible fix by defining constants a bit
       differently) (garvinhicking)

    * Default Admin Stylesheet no longer uses direct height: assignment,
      but padding instead. This should get rid of occasional overlapping
      of menu items. Thanks a lot to Ognyan Kulev for the solution to this!

      Thanks to Nate Johnston for working this out! (garvinhicking)

      (wesley)

    * Fix cosmetic warning message about missing S9Y_PEAR_PATH when
      installing. (garvinhicking)

Version 0.8.4 (August 19th, 2005)

      large sizing in Internet Explorer. Thanks to frodeste from the
      Forums!

    * Hide title of an entry in the frontend, if entry is draft and not
      displayed. Fixes Bug #1260667 (garvinhicking)

    * Unbundle Serendipity XML-RPC functions from the bundled distribution.
      You will now need to install the additional plugin "Post via XML-RPC"
      (serendipity_event_xmlrpc) to make entry posts via this interface.
      The ongoing security issues with this interface and the little usage
      of this functionality by the broad public have forced this move.
      After installing this plugin you can use the same URL and nothing
      will change for XML-RPC users. (garvinhicking)

   * Optionally allow using a local PEAR installation. Set
     $serendipity['use_PEAR'] = true
     in your serendipity_config_local.inc.php or serendipity_config.inc.php
     file. The required packages can be found in the
     bundled-libs/.current_version file. (garvinhicking)

   * Make categories sidebar plugin show categories' description, not the
     name on mouse over (garvinhicking)

   * Added new config option "blogMail" that specifies the blog's used

     (garvinhicking)

   * Fix possible exploit that sends comments to the blog owner and others
     with arbitrary mailheaders and a link to invalid entries. Thanks to
     Sebastian Raible! (garvinhicking)

      <div class='serendipity_entryFooter' style="text-align: center">
        {serendipity_hookPlugin hook="entries_footer"}
      </div>
     (wesley)

    * Fix RSS 1.0 missing top-level namespace (garvinhicking)

    * Deactivated gzip compression by default, as in certain server

    * Allow the serendipity_event_trackback additional trackbacks plugin
      to send trackbacks even if your entry did not contain at least one

      default, kubrick and wp templates (sidebar.tpl) (garvinhicking)

    * Fix error "Warning: ob_start(): output handler 'ob_gzhandler'
      cannot be used after 'URL-Rewriter'" which can occur on installations
      where session.use_trans_sid is activated and Serendipity's gzip
      compression is used. (garvinhicking)

      Windows servers. Thanks to BobRock! (garvinhicking)

    * BBCode plugin: Allow =, ~ and ! URL characters (garvinhicking)

      proper cachability for Conditional Get (garvinhicking)

    * Fix issues on Windows installations: %T strftime-Option not known
      when saving a plugin and emitting timestamp (was empty),
      redirecting to a wrong URL for installation with '\' instead of

    * Make RSS import parse ISO-8601 dates (like
      '2004-11-24T22:43:08-05:00'), as PHPs strtotime() does not parse

      a dropdown instead of needing to edit a Serendipity core file.

      (garvinhicking)

    * When entering a comment, the referring URL to the blog is saved
      (garvinhicking)

      (garvinhicking)

      caching interacts with other plugins: When cacheable plugins are
      added, the cache is updated, as well as when an entry is modified.

      latest 15 entries; you can create a cache of all entries using
      the admin interface. (garvinhicking)

      (garvinhicking)

    * Plugin API: Event plugins using the 'entry_display' hook to set
      an entries page to not render (via 'clean_page') now need to use
      the new hook 'entries_header' for their output; the 'clean_page'
      variable still needs to be set within the hook 'entry_display'
      though. (garvinhicking)

    * Support for adding timezone offsets in configuration
      (garvinhicking)

      any property to an entry and query it. Currently implemented
      are "sticky posts" and "private/public/members-only" entries.

      trackback (tomsommer)

      - Removed 'align' attribute from <div> tags, replaced with new
        CSS class 'serendipity_align'
      - Show the pingback-link element in the HEAD area. Embedded blogs
        need to do that on their own.
      - New plugin 'serendipity_event_xhtmlcleanup' to correct most
        common XHTML errors (unclosed single tags, missing 'alt'

      name added to the default "serendipitySideBarContent" one, which
      is called 'sidebar_wrap_', 'sidebar_title_', 'sidebar_content_'
      and then the original class name of the plugin appended. I.e.:
