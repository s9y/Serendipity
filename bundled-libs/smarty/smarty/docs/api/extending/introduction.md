# Extending Smarty

By default, Smarty is already very complete and powerful. However, you can unlock its real potential by 
extending Smarty.

There are various ways to extend Smarty for it to suit your needs. You can create custom
[tags](tags.md), [block tags](block-tags.md) and [modifiers](modifiers.md) by registering a method as a plugin.

If this becomes too messy, you can group your custom tags, modifiers, and more into an [Extension](extensions.md).
